## Project Description <a name="description"></a>
This full-stack application utilizes the MVC paradigm and a server-side API.  Event Planner was designed to make it easier for members of a schoolboard to plan events and assign team leaders as well as vendors.  The user can fill out a form to schedule an event, and when submitted it is stored in a MySQL database.  Our original concept was beyond the scope of our team's knowledge.  With more time to develop this application we would add the following functionality:
- Events dynamically appear on the calender
- User can edit/cancel events
- Events would be color-coded by category
- Events could be flagged 'need attention' if vendors/team leaders needed to be assigned for the event to take place.
- User login/authentification for staff
